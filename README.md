A standalone desktop launcher for **Jupyter** and **marimo** notebooks, and **plain Python scripts**. Double-click to run any `.ipynb` or `.py` file that has inline dependencies, no Python installation required.

Files must declare their dependencies using the [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline script metadata format. The launcher uses [juv](https://github.com/manzt/juv) + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for `.ipynb` files, [marimo](https://marimo.io/) + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for `.py` files that declare `marimo` as a dependency, and plain `uv run` for other `.py` scripts.

## How it works

1. Download and unzip the file for your platform
2. Double-click the executable (`.app` on macOS, `.exe` on Windows)
3. A file picker appears — select a `.ipynb` or `.py` file
4. The file opens in your browser (notebooks) or terminal (scripts)

**First run only:** `uv` and all packages are downloaded and cached automatically. Subsequent runs are fast.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `uv` is not already installed, the launcher will download and install it automatically on first run — no permission prompt will appear. On Windows, the launcher also silently sets the PowerShell execution policy to `RemoteSigned` for the current user to ensure the install script can run. On managed or enterprise machines where Group Policy enforces the execution policy, this may be blocked — in that case, an administrator will need to allow PowerShell scripts to run.

### Platform notes

**macOS Gatekeeper warning:** on first launch macOS may show a popup with only "Delete" or "Done" as options and block the app from opening. If this happens:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page
3. You will see a message about the app being blocked — click **"Open Anyway"**

**Windows SmartScreen warning:** on first launch Windows may show a warning that the app is from an unknown publisher. If this happens:

1. Click **"More info"** on the warning dialog
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

### What users need

- An internet connection on first run (to fetch `uv` and packages — cached locally after that)
- Nothing else, no Python, no conda, no pip!

## Preparing your files

Under the hood, pyrunner uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run scripts in isolated environments. All files must declare their dependencies using [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline script metadata. Since `uv` is the runner, you can use any feature it supports for scripts — including [alternative indexes](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#using-alternative-package-indexes), [reproducibility pinning](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#improving-reproducibility), and the full [`[tool.uv]`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) configuration block.

### Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)

The launcher runs `.ipynb` files using `uvx juv run`, which requires each notebook to declare its dependencies inline using [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) script metadata.

#### Option 1: Use `juv add` (recommended)

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then add dependencies to your notebook:

```bash
uvx juv add my_notebook.ipynb numpy pandas matplotlib
```

This writes a hidden `# /// script` cell into the notebook. You can verify it works locally:

```bash
uvx juv run my_notebook.ipynb
```

#### Option 2: Add the metadata manually

Add a code cell at the top of your notebook with:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "numpy>=1.26",
#   "pandas>=2.0",
#   "matplotlib>=3.8",
# ]
# ///
```

This cell tells `juv` which packages to install in the isolated environment.

### Python scripts (`.py`)

The launcher inspects each `.py` file for [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline script metadata and chooses the right runner automatically:

- If `marimo` is listed as a dependency → opens in edit mode by default (or the mode fixed in the file)
- Otherwise → runs with `uv run`

#### marimo notebooks

`marimo` must be listed as a dependency — this is how pyrunner detects that a `.py` file is a marimo notebook and opens it with `marimo` instead of `uv run`.

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "marimo",
#   "numpy>=1.26",
#   "pandas>=2.0",
# ]
# ///
```

You can verify it works locally:

```bash
uvx marimo edit my_notebook.py
# or in read-only mode:
uvx marimo run my_notebook.py
```

#### Fixing the open mode

By default marimo notebooks open in edit mode. To pin a notebook to a specific mode — for example a read-only notebook — add a `[pyrunner]` section inside the `# /// script` block:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "marimo",
#   "numpy>=1.26",
# ]
#
# [pyrunner]
# marimo-mode = "run"  # or "edit" (default)
# ///
```

Accepted values:

| Value    | Effect                                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"run"`  | Opens in read-only app mode (`marimo run`)                       |
| `"edit"` | Opens in full editor mode (`marimo edit`) — this is the default  |

`uv` ignores the `[pyrunner]` section when running the script — it only reads `requires-python`, `dependencies`, and `[tool.uv]`.

#### Plain Python scripts

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "numpy>=1.26",
#   "pandas>=2.0",
# ]
# ///
```

You can verify it works locally:

```bash
uv run my_script.py
```

#### Using `[tool.uv]` in script metadata

Since pyrunner uses `uv` under the hood, you can use the [`[tool.uv]`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) configuration block inside your script metadata for advanced features like alternative package indexes or reproducibility pinning:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "numpy>=1.26",
#   "pandas>=2.0",
# ]
#
# [[tool.uv.index]]
# url = "https://example.com/simple"
#
# [tool.uv]
# exclude-newer = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
# ///
```

See the [uv scripts guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) for all supported options.
